##  [3.1.](https://docs.haproxy.org/3.2/intro.html#3.1) What HAProxy is and isn't
```
HAProxy is :

  - a TCP proxy : it can accept a TCP connection from a listening socket,
    connect to a server and attach these sockets together allowing traffic to
    flow in both directions; IPv4, IPv6 and even UNIX sockets are supported on
    either side, so this can provide an easy way to translate addresses between
    different families.

  - an HTTP reverse-proxy (called a "gateway" in HTTP terminology) : it presents
    itself as a server, receives HTTP requests over connections accepted on a
    listening TCP socket, and passes the requests from these connections to
    servers using different connections. It may use any combination of HTTP/1.x
    or HTTP/2 on any side and will even automatically detect the protocol
    spoken on each side when ALPN is used over TLS.

  - an SSL terminator / initiator / offloader : SSL/TLS may be used on the
    connection coming from the client, on the connection going to the server,
    or even on both connections. A lot of settings can be applied per name
    (SNI), and may be updated at runtime without restarting. Such setups are
    extremely scalable and deployments involving tens to hundreds of thousands
    of certificates were reported.

  - a TCP normalizer : since connections are locally terminated by the operating
    system, there is no relation between both sides, so abnormal traffic such as
    invalid packets, flag combinations, window advertisements, sequence numbers,
    incomplete connections (SYN floods), or so will not be passed to the other
    side. This protects fragile TCP stacks from protocol attacks, and also
    allows to optimize the connection parameters with the client without having
    to modify the servers' TCP stack settings.

  - an HTTP normalizer : when configured to process HTTP traffic, only valid
    complete requests are passed. This protects against a lot of protocol-based
    attacks. Additionally, protocol deviations for which there is a tolerance
    in the specification are fixed so that they don't cause problem on the
    servers (e.g. multiple-line headers).

  - an HTTP fixing tool : it can modify / fix / add / remove / rewrite the URL
    or any request or response header. This helps fixing interoperability issues
    in complex environments.

  - a content-based switch : it can consider any element from the request to
    decide what server to pass the request or connection to. Thus it is possible
    to handle multiple protocols over a same port (e.g. HTTP, HTTPS, SSH).

  - a server load balancer : it can load balance TCP connections and HTTP
    requests. In TCP mode, load balancing decisions are taken for the whole
    connection. In HTTP mode, decisions are taken per request.

  - a traffic regulator : it can apply some rate limiting at various points,
    protect the servers against overloading, adjust traffic priorities based on
    the contents, and even pass such information to lower layers and outer
    network components by marking packets.

  - a protection against DDoS and service abuse : it can maintain a wide number
    of statistics per IP address, URL, cookie, etc and detect when an abuse is
    happening, then take action (slow down the offenders, block them, send them
    to outdated contents, etc).

  - an observation point for network troubleshooting : due to the precision of
    the information reported in logs, it is often used to narrow down some
    network-related issues.

  - an HTTP compression offloader : it can compress responses which were not
    compressed by the server, thus reducing the page load time for clients with
    poor connectivity or using high-latency, mobile networks.

  - a caching proxy : it may cache responses in RAM so that subsequent requests
    for the same object avoid the cost of another network transfer from the
    server as long as the object remains present and valid. It will however not
    store objects to any persistent storage. Please note that this caching
    feature is designed to be maintenance free and focuses solely on saving
    haproxy's precious resources and not on save the server's resources. Caches
    designed to optimize servers require much more tuning and flexibility. If
    you instead need such an advanced cache, please use Varnish Cache, which
    integrates perfectly with haproxy, especially when SSL/TLS is needed on any
    side.

  - a FastCGI gateway : FastCGI can be seen as a different representation of
    HTTP, and as such, HAProxy can directly load-balance a farm comprising any
    combination of FastCGI application servers without requiring to insert
    another level of gateway between them. This results in resource savings and
    a reduction of maintenance costs.

HAProxy is not :

  - an explicit HTTP proxy, i.e. the proxy that browsers use to reach the
    internet. There are excellent open-source software dedicated for this task,
    such as Squid. However HAProxy can be installed in front of such a proxy to
    provide load balancing and high availability.

  - a data scrubber : it will not modify the body of requests nor responses.

  - a static web server : during startup, it isolates itself inside a chroot
    jail and drops its privileges, so that it will not perform any single file-
    system access once started. As such it cannot be turned into a static web
    server (dynamic servers are supported through FastCGI however). There are
    excellent open-source software for this such as Apache or Nginx, and
    HAProxy can be easily installed in front of them to provide load balancing,
    high availability and acceleration.

  - a packet-based load balancer : it will not see IP packets nor UDP datagrams,
    will not perform NAT or even less DSR. These are tasks for lower layers.
    Some kernel-based components such as IPVS (Linux Virtual Server) already do
    this pretty well and complement perfectly with HAProxy.
