Full message: {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '', 'thinking': 'Okay, let\'s tackle this HAProxy question. So, the user wants me to extract specific information from the given HAProxy section. Let me read through the problem again.\n\nFirst, they need 5-1: Keywords (5-10 technical terms in the text). The section provided is about the server configuration in HAProxy. The settings listed are disabled, backup, weight, check, inter, fall, rise. Also, the description mentions things like health checks, intervals, failed checks, etc.\n\nLet me list out the technical terms here. The main terms here are probably: server, address, port, settings, disabled, backup, weight, check, inter, fall, rise. But the user wants 5-10 keywords. Let me check the section again.\n\nThe section says: "server <name> <address>[:port] [settings ...]". Then the settings are listed with their descriptions. So the keywords should be terms that are technical in this context. Let\'s see.\n\nPossible keywords: server, address, port, disabled, backup, weight, check, inter, fall, rise, healthchecks (since check is mentioned as "Enable health checks"), interval (inter is interval), fail (fall), rise.\n\nWait, the problem says "Mots-cles techniques presents dans le texte" so the technical terms present in the text. Let me look at the text provided.\n\nThe text says: "server <name> <address>[:port] [settings ...]". Then the settings are listed with their descriptions. The keywords here would be the terms that are specific to HAProxy configuration.\n\nSo, from the text, the technical terms are:\n\n- server\n- address\n- port\n- disabled\n- backup\n- weight\n- check\n- inter\n- fall\n- rise\n\nBut the user wants 5-10 keywords. Let\'s count. The section mentions "server", "address", "port", "settings", "disabled", "backup", "weight", "check", "inter", "fall", "rise". So maybe 8 terms here. Let\'s pick 5-10. Let\'s see.\n\nThe problem says 5-10, so I need to choose 5 to 10. Let\'s list them:\n\n1. server\n2. address\n3. port\n4. disabled\n5. backup\n6. weight\n7. check\n8.'}
